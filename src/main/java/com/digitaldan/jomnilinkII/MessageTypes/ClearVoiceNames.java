 * CLEAR VOICE NAMES
 *
 * If a group of voice names will be written to the HAI controller, first send
 * the CLEAR VOICE NAMES message to the controller. This instructs the
 * controller to clear the voice names of all objects. This is essential to
 * ensure that object voice names that have been removed are cleared from the
 * controllerâ€™s memory.
