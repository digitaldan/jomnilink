/*
 * ZONE STATUS
 *
 * The controller reports the status of a zone object or group of zone objects.
 * The status reported for each zone includes the zone number, current condition
 * of the zone (secure, not ready, or trouble), the latched alarm status for the
 * zone, whether the zone is armed, whether the zone has had any trouble, and
 * the current analog loop reading for the zone.
 *
 *     Start character      0x21
 *     Message length       (4 * number of zone) + 2
 *     Message Type         0x23
 *     Data 1               0x01
 *     Data 2               zone number for first zone (MSB)
 *     Data 3               zone number for first zone (LSB)
 *     Data 4               zone status for first zone
 *     Data 5               zone loop reading for first zone
 *     Data 6               zone number for second zone (MSB)
 *     Data 7               zone number for second zone (LSB)
 *     Data 8               zone status for second zone
 *     Data 9               zone loop reading for second zone
 *     ...
 *     Data n-3             zone number for last zone (MSB)
 *     Data n-2             zone number for last zone (LSB)
 *     Data n-1             zone status for last zone
 *     Data n               zone loop reading for last zone
 *     CRC 1                varies
 *     CRC 2                varies
 *
 * The zone status for a zone is packed into a single byte. Bits 0 and 1
 * indicate the zoneâ€™s current condition:
 *
 * -------------------------------------
 * | Bit 1 | Bit 0 | Current Condition |
 * |-------|-------|-------------------|
 * | 0     | 0     | Secure            |
 * |-------|-------|-------------------|
 * | 0     | 1     | Not ready         |
 * |-------|-------|-------------------|
 * | 1     | 0     | Trouble           |
 * -------------------------------------
 *
 * Bits 2 and 3 indicate the latched alarm status for the zone:
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * | Bit 3 | Bit 2 |     Latched Alarm Status      |
 * |-------|-------|-------------------------------|
 * | 0     | 0     | Secure                        |
 * |-------|-------|-------------------------------|
 * | 0     | 1     | Tripped                       |
 * |-------|-------|-------------------------------|
 * | 1     | 0     | Reset, but previously tripped |
 * -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Bits 4 and 5 indicate the arming status for the zone:
 *
 * --------------------------------------
 * | Bit 5 | Bit 4 |   Arming Status    |
 * |-------|-------|--------------------|
 * | 0     | 0     | Disarmed           |
 * |-------|-------|--------------------|
 * | 0     | 1     | Armed              |
 * |-------|-------|--------------------|
 * | 1     | 0     | Bypassed by user   |
 * |-------|-------|--------------------|
 * | 1     | 1     | Bypassed by system |
 * --------------------------------------
 *
 * Bit 6 is set if a trouble condition has occurred that has not been
 * acknowledged by the user. The current condition of the zone will indicate
 * whether the zone currently has a trouble condition. If the zone does not
 * currently have a trouble condition, but bit 6 is set, it indicates that the
 * zone has previously had a trouble condition that has not yet been
 * acknowledged.
