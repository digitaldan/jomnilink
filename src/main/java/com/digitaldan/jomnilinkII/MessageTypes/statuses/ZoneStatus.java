	 * ZONE STATUS The controller reports the status of a zone object or group of

	 * alarm status for the zone, whether the zone is armed, whether the zone has
	 * had any trouble, and the current analog loop reading for the zone. Start

	 * Bits 2 and 3 indicate the latched alarm status for the zone: Bit 3 Bit 2
	 * Latched Alarm Status 0 0 Secure 0 1 Tripped 1 0 Reset, but previously tripped
	 * Bits 4 and 5 indicate the arming status for the zone: Bit 5 Bit 4 Arming
	 * Status 0 0 Disarmed 0 1 Armed 1 0 Bypassed by user 1 1 Bypassed by system
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Bit 6 is set if a trouble condition has occurred that has not been
	 * acknowledged by the user. The current condition of the zone will indicate
	 * whether the zone currently has a trouble condition. If the zone does not
	 * currently have a trouble condition, but bit 6 is set, it indicates that the
	 * zone has previously had a trouble condition that has not yet been
	 * acknowledged.
